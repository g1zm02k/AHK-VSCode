# AHK-VSCode
Personal fix to override Mark Wiemer's pre-emptive suggestions.

Behold, my personal fix of Mark Wiemer's extraneous code suggestions - in short, it'll remove the bumpf and leave only the keyword.

My original plan was to create a hotkey to remove the rest of the line when Shift+Enter was pressed but that screwed up mid-code editing - I needed to just get rid of the whole thing and go back to basics.

It works. All of it works fine, the helper code ('Ctrl+Space' Shows the command syntax, 'Ctrl+Alt+Space' show the full description*, Alt+Space opens the docs for that command) but I get an error when it loads Wiemer's code for some reason - even though the json code is correct!

*Bearing in mind the display window is configured to my only having the VSCode window open in the top right of my 1920x1080 screen.
